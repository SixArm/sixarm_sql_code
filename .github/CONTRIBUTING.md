## Contributing to the source

We love pull requests for improvments to the source code and documentation.

There are three easy steps:

1. Fork the repo. 

  * Before you do any work please run our existing tests to make sure the code runs cleanly.

2. Work as you like. 

  * If your code can use tests, please create them. This helps us know your code runs cleanly.

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

  * We'll take a look as soon as we can; this is typically within a business day.

Thank you again!
